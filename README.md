# SIMULATION-STUDY-OF-FOOTSTEP-POWER-GENERATION
To develop a power generation system using piezoelectric sensors which generates power with the help of human footsteps. The energy is produced by the ground reaction force generated due to human foot step and this energy is focused on an array of piezoelectric sensor which further converts this to electrical energy which can be stored in a battery
