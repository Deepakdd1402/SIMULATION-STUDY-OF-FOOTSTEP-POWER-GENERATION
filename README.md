# SIMULATION-STUDY-OF-FOOTSTEP-POWER-GENERATION
To develop a power generation system using piezoelectric sensors which generates power with the help of human footsteps. The energy is produced by the ground reaction force generated due to human foot step and this energy is focused on an array of piezoelectric sensor which further converts this to electrical energy which can be stored in a battery

**Footstep Power Generation System** 
This project aims to harness the energy generated by human footsteps through a smart and eco-friendly approach. By utilizing piezoelectric sensors placed beneath walking platforms, the system converts mechanical energy from foot pressure into electrical energy. This energy is then stored in a battery for various applications such as street lighting, notice boards, gyms, and public areas.

**Features:**
Piezoelectric Sensors: Array of sensors strategically positioned to maximize energy conversion from ground reaction force.
Microcontroller Monitoring Circuit: Monitors voltage and charges, displaying data on an LCD for user convenience.
USB Charging Point: Enables mobile phone charging directly from the stored battery power, providing a practical utility for users.
RFID Authorization: Ensures only authorized individuals can access the charging capabilities of the system, enhancing security and control.
Benefits:
Cost-Effective: Utilizes readily available components and simple implementation, making it affordable for widespread adoption.
Environmentally Friendly: Promotes green energy by harnessing renewable sources without harmful emissions or pollution.
Versatile Applications: Suitable for various public spaces and facilities, contributing to sustainable energy practices in urban environments.
